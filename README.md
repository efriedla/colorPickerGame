## This is a game where you can practice your rgb() color skills 
#### Live Site : https://efriedla.github.io/colorPickerGame/
### New Game
 - Here you can see that all the colors are randomized when "New Colors" is clicked
     - By using two functions one to randomly pick a number using rgb for each box. The other to randomize the color connecting red = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256), green = ... , blue = ...

### If wrong
- These next two I put in a function called ifCorrect
    - If the color picked matches the color that is correct then the player will know it else you can continue clicking

### Change difficulty
- Here you can choose the difficulty
     - Easy has three boxes while the other three not being used have a display of none
     -  Vice versa if the difficulty is "hard" than you have six boxes to choose from and can those boxes that had display of none now have a display of block.
     - The Default is on Hard
